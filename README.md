This is a repository of the analysis of microclimate data of the City of Melbourne. The primary question of the analysis is: 
**Is there evidence of a microclimate within Melbourne, 
that is, are there noticeable differences in the temperature across the city?**

This repository also contains a slide presentations (tau_microclimate.Rmd) that was created with R's Xaringan package.
